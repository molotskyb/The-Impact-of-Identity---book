							The world is rapidly changing and our beliefs are being
							challenged. Many of us are uncomfortable with the political,
							religious, and social changes taking place. This book offers a new
							approach to establishing a clear, resilient identity and enjoying
							a more positive, meaningful life. Irina Nevzlin’s life experience
							and entrepreneurial background have led her to develop the
							understanding that our global world has made us all immigrants to
							some extent. This unique book offers a fresh perspective on how
							each of us can adapt with more ease to our ever-changing, complex
							world.

							From the Author
						</h3>
						<p class="paragraph">
							"I woke up one morning in December 2018 with a book in my head. I
							had never thought of writing a book, but I felt an urge to share a
							message that derives from personal experience. As Guy Kawasaki
							says: "Learning by anecdote is risky, but waiting for scientific
							proof is too." My message is very simple: there are many things we
							can do and decisions we can make that reduce fear, generate
							meaning, and enhance enjoyment while we explore life in our
							fast-changing world. If you want to make your life better, this is
							the book for you."

							<p>
								Irina Nevzlin grew up, studied, and started her career in
								Moscow. She continued in London at a large international company
								serving as a communications consultant and then moved to Israel
								in 2006.
							</p>
							<p>
								In her current capacity as chair of the Board of the Museum of
								the Jewish People in Tel Aviv, Irina, together with the new
								team, conducted a comprehensive, transformation of the museum.
								Alongside developing a new concept, they raised $100 million for
								the construction of a new museum. This bold change helped the
								museum establish and promote a novel paradigm of what it means
								to be Jewish, a sense of belonging and unity. Together with
								partners, Irina founded the Israeli Center for Better Childhood,
								a non-profit that empowers students in the periphery of Israel
								through scholarships and helps children suffering from
								blood-related diseases.
							</p>
							<p>
								Irina also serves as the president of the Nadav Foundation,
								designed to strengthen a positive collective Jewish identity.
								Irina believes that to have a meaningful and positive life
								experience, it essential to invest time and energy in building
								your own personal identity, strengthening your roots, and
								developing your collective identity.
							</p>
							<p>
								Her book The Impact of Identity - The Power of Knowing Who You
								Are (2019) was awarded the Nautilus Award (Silver) for best book
								in the category: Inner Prosperity & Right Livelihood. A popular
								influencer and speaker at international events, she was chosen
								by The Jerusalem Post as one of the 50 most influential Jews in
								the world.
							</p>
							<p>
								Irina is married to Yuli-Yoel Edelstein, who has been Speaker of
								the Israeli Knesset since 2013. She is also a mother of two.
